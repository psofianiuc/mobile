As a user, I want to be able to save all the movies I want to watch and those that I already watched.
Each movie should have a title, director and the year it was created. Also, I want to make a difference between the ones I watched and those I didn't.
I want to be able to add, remove, update a movie (if i watched it) and see them all in a list.
