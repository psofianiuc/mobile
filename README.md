# React-native: RateMyCat

This app will enable users to see pictures of cats, their name and a short description. They can give a rate for each cat and and, at the end of each month, it will be published the best cat in a separate section. 
A rater account will be able to rate a cat, add it to favorites and write a comment. The cat account will have all the rater account functionality, but in addition will have to manage its cat profile by adding information about it. It will also have access to a graphic that keeps track on how many users rated his profile the last month.

# iOS (licenta): GlobalWalk

Each user will be able to track all the places he has been to by taking pictures and adding a description. Each place will be shown on a map. Also, he will be able to see where he is walking, the marks his passing by and check them out.
